# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      ```
      Your answer...


Good Visualization Example: 
COVID-19 Vaccine Data Dashboard (link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/idaho.division.of.public.health/viz/COVID-19VaccineDataDashboard/LandingPage)

The COVID-19 Vaccine Data Dashboard, created by Idahoâ€™s Division of Public Health, is an excellent example of effective data visualization. It presents detailed insights into vaccine distribution, dose administration, and regional vaccination rates.

Reasons for Classification:
The dashboard is well-organized with clear labels, headings, and legends. It uses interactive features to allow users to explore specific regions and demographics. Each chart is accompanied by explanatory text, ensuring viewers can easily understand the data.

Effective Use of Colors and Layout:The colors are muted and intuitive, representing categories like "doses administered" and "population coverage" without overwhelming the viewer. The layout follows a logical flow, making it easy to navigate.

Contextual Information:The dashboard includes population benchmarks and goals, enabling users to contextualize the data. For instance, showing the percentage of the population vaccinated against the target adds narrative depth.

Interactivity: Users can filter data by region, age group, and other demographics. This customization enhances usability, allowing stakeholders to derive specific insights.

How could this data visualization have been improved?  
While the dashboard is highly effective, several enhancements could further elevate its usability and accessibility:
1.Adding a summary section at the top to highlight critical metrics, such as the stateâ€™s overall vaccination rate, would immediately capture attention.
2.While the dashboard is detailed, simplifying it for smaller screens would make it more accessible to a broader audience.

Bad Visualization Example: Pharmaceutical Data Analytics
link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/chandini.tadepalli/viz/PharmaceuticalDataAnalytics/PharmacyAnalytics

The Pharmaceutical Data Analytics dashboard aims to showcase metrics like profit-making drugs and sales across regions. However, it falls short due to design and accessibility issues.

Reasons for Classification:
Overwhelming Use of Colors: The dashboard uses bright, clashing colors for its charts and graphs, making it difficult to distinguish between categories. This lack of a cohesive color scheme confuses viewers and detracts from the narrative.

Cluttered Layout: The visualization attempts to display too much information on a single screen. Overlapping graphs and densely packed text create visual noise, making it hard to focus on any specific insight.

Ineffective Chart Types: For example, a 3D pie chart is used to represent top-selling drugs, which distorts proportions and makes it challenging to compare values accurately.

Lack of Context: There are no explanations or annotations to help viewers understand why the displayed metrics are significant. This reduces the effectiveness of the visualization in communicating its story.

How could this data visualization have been improved?  

Simplify and Organize Layout: Break the dashboard into multiple tabs or sections, focusing on specific aspects such as sales trends, regional data, and drug profitability. This segmentation would reduce visual clutter.

Use Appropriate Chart Types:Replace the 3D pie chart with a bar chart or treemap for clarity and accuracy in comparing values.

Improve Color Scheme: Adopt a muted, cohesive palette with consistent associations for categories (e.g., sales trends in blue shades, regional data in green).

Add Contextual Annotations: Include brief insights or explanations for each graph to guide viewers and highlight significant findings.





      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
