# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
Good Visualization: COVID-19 Vaccine Data Dashboard
Accessibility: The dashboard is highly accessible. Its interactive features, clear labels, and straightforward design make it user-friendly. However, color-blind users might struggle with distinguishing certain data points if they rely solely on color. Incorporating texture or pattern variations could further improve accessibility.

Reproducibility: The dashboard uses transparent data sources and methodology, making it reproducible. It cites sources and provides metadata, allowing others to verify or replicate the visualizations.

Equity: The visualization promotes equity by including demographic filters (e.g., age, race, region), which can uncover disparities in vaccine distribution. However, the inclusion of more granular socioeconomic data would better support equity-focused analysis.
Overall, while visually engaging, the dashboard falls short of being fully inclusive or usable by all audiences.

Bad Visualization: Pharmaceutical Data Analytics
Accessibility: The cluttered layout and overwhelming colors reduce accessibility. Users may struggle to interpret key insights, particularly if they rely on assistive technologies or have color vision deficiencies.

Reproducibility: The visualization lacks citations for data sources, limiting reproducibility. Without access to raw data or explanations of metrics, reproducing the analysis is nearly impossible.

Equity: This dashboard fails to address equity concerns. The metrics presented focus on profits rather than public health impacts, missing an opportunity to explore how pharmaceutical trends affect different population groups.


    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
Good Visualization: COVID-19 Vaccine Data Dashboard
Improvements:
1) Enhancing Accessibility: Introduce colorblind-friendly palettes and alternative textures for data representation. Add screen reader compatibility for interactive elements.

2) Improving Equity: Include overlays or additional metrics for social determinants of health, such as income level or geographic access to healthcare facilities.

3) Reproducibility Enhancements: Provide downloadable datasets directly from the dashboard to allow for more straightforward external analysis.


Bad Visualization: Pharmaceutical Data Analytics
Improvements:
1) Improving Accessibility: Simplify the layout by removing 3D effects and organizing content into separate tabs or sections. Use accessible color schemes and provide alternative text for visual elements.

2) Improving Reproducibility: Clearly cite data sources and provide explanations for the metrics. Adding downloadable datasets would allow others to verify and extend the analysis.

3) Improving Equity: Shift focus to include metrics that explore the societal impact of pharmaceutical trends, such as drug availability in underserved areas or affordability.

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
